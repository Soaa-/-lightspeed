Changelog
_________________________________
Oct 27, 2009 - v 1.4

-added IP Gre tunnel module:

This particular tunneling driver implements
GRE (Generic Routing Encapsulation) and at this time allows
encapsulating of IPv4 or IPv6 over existing IPv4 infrastructure.
This driver is useful if the other endpoint is a Cisco router: Cisco
likes GRE much better.




-Added cifs module

This gives ability to mount Samba/Windows shares directly 
For example:
mount -t cifs //ServerIP/shareName -o credentials=/some_path/sambacred.txt,rw,auto,user,uid=1000,iocharset=utf8,file_mode=0770,dir_mode=0770 

you can store your credentials in a file you create (in the example: /some_path/sambacred.txt)

This file needs to have following format:
username=your_user_name
password=your_password




-Added some bluetooth features (BNEP multicats filter and protocol filter) in case it is needed by future Bluetooth tools contributed by the community


-Removed all kernel debugging code not needed when we use this kernel on a phone and we don't want to debug. Might slightly decrese overhead and make things a bit faster. Be aware that in case you have issues, it will be harder to debug, but again who is going to read stack traces, debug outputs etc... apart from a kernel hacker.
